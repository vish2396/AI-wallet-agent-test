# Coinbase-SDK - AI Feedback Tool 

AI Feedback tool is a simple application built with [Coinbase SDK](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/coinbase-sdk/docs/welcome). The application shows how to create an [MPC wallet](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/mpc-wallet/docs/welcome), fund the wallet, and transfer eth on Base-Sepolia network to a recipient.

## Getting Started
To start, [create a CDP API Key](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/access/api). Then, create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```text
NAME="YOUR_API_KEY_NAME"
PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_PRIVATE"
WALLET_DATA={ "WALLET_ID": { "seed": "", "encrypted": false, "authTag": "", "iv": "" } }
```

`WALLET_DATA` is optional. If you don't have a wallet, you can remove the `WALLET_DATA` field. 
If you have a wallet, make sure the wallet you are using is funded before running the application.

Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to use the application.
